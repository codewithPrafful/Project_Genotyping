# Project: Antibiotic Resistance Genotyping in Bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis)
This is the final project of my 5 weeks HackBio internship on finding resistance gene to avoid the misuse of antibiotic in the world. 
This results in the control of antibiotic resistance and proper usage of antibiotics throughout the world.
